# docker-networking-and-logging
Docker assignment including a multi-container setup with a custom logging container, Nginx web server, and Fluentd log collector. Demonstrates Docker volumes, networking, and resource limits.
This repository contains a Docker-based project demonstrating key containerization concepts:
A custom logging container using cron to log timestamps every minute
An Nginx container serving static web content on port 8080
A Fluentd container collecting logs from shared volumes and printing to stdout
Docker networking using a custom bridge network for container communication
Persistent data storage using Docker volumes
Resource limits applied to containers for CPU and memory control
Includes a complete setup using Docker Compose
Hi All 
Below is an docker assignment for you
Complete it and let us know 
I have given the steps aswell, go through them and understand each concepts 
‚Äò‚Äô‚Äô
1. Create a Dockerfile for a Custom Logging Container
‚Ä¢ Inside the container:
‚Ä¢ Install cron
‚Ä¢ Create a cron job that writes the time to a log file every minute
‚Ä¢ Mount a volume at /var/logs/ to persist logs
‚∏ª
2. Set Up Nginx
‚Ä¢ Mount a local HTML file (index.html) using a Docker volume
‚Ä¢ Expose port 8080 and check that Nginx serves your content
‚∏ª
3. Add Fluentd to Collect Logs
‚Ä¢ Use fluent/fluentd image
‚Ä¢ Configure it to:
‚Ä¢ Read logs from the volume shared with your custom Alpine container
‚Ä¢ Print those logs to stdout
‚∏ª
4. Docker Networking
‚Ä¢ Create a custom bridge network
‚Ä¢ Connect all containers to it
‚Ä¢ Ensure Nginx and Fluentd can talk to other containers via container names 
‚∏ª
5. Logging Validation
‚Ä¢ Check that your cron job logs are:
‚Ä¢ Written to volume
‚Ä¢ Picked up by Fluentd
‚Ä¢ Printed to stdout
‚∏ª
6. Clean Restart Test
‚Ä¢ Stop and remove all containers
‚Ä¢ Start again
‚Ä¢ Ensure:
‚Ä¢ Logs are still there (volume works)
‚Ä¢ Cron restarts
‚Ä¢ Nginx still serves HTML
‚∏ª
7. Limit CPU and memory usage for each container

üê≥ Docker Multi-Container Assignment
üìò Overview
This project demonstrates the use of Docker containers to set up:
A Custom Logging Container that logs the current time every minute using cron
An Nginx web server serving static content
A Fluentd container collecting and printing logs from shared volumes
Docker networking for inter-container communication
Volumes for data persistence
Resource limits for CPU and memory management

1. Custom Logging Container

File: cron-logger/Dockerfile
FROM alpine:latest

RUN apk add --no-cache bash curl tzdata busybox-suid \
    && apk add --no-cache openrc cron

RUN mkdir -p /var/logs

COPY cronjob.sh /cronjob.sh
RUN chmod +x /cronjob.sh

RUN echo "* * * * * /cronjob.sh >> /var/logs/cron.log 2>&1" > /etc/crontabs/root

CMD ["crond", "-f", "-d", "8"]

File: cron-logger/cronjob.sh

#!/bin/sh
echo "Current time: $(date)"

üåê 2. Nginx Setup
File: nginx/Dockerfile
FROM nginx:alpine
COPY index.html /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html
EXPOSE 8080

File: nginx/index.html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Docker Nginx Page</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Welcome to the Docker Assignment!</h1>
</body>
</html>
You can access it at http://localhost:8080

üì¶ 3. Fluentd Configuration

File: fluentd/fluent.conf
<source>
  @type tail
  path /var/logs/cron.log
  pos_file /var/log/cron.pos
  tag cron.logs
  format none
</source>

<match **>
  @type stdout
</match>
Fluentd reads the cron logs and prints them to stdout.

üîó 4. Docker Compose Setup
File: docker-compose.yml
version: "3.9"

services:
  cron-logger:
    build: ./cron-logger
    volumes:
      - cron-logs:/var/logs
    deploy:
      resources:
        limits:
          cpus: '0.5'
          memory: 256M
    networks:
      - mynet

  nginx:
    build: ./nginx
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
    networks:
      - mynet

  fluentd:
    image: fluent/fluentd:latest
    volumes:
      - cron-logs:/var/logs
      - ./fluentd/fluent.conf:/fluentd/etc/fluent.conf
    networks:
      - mynet

volumes:
  cron-logs:

networks:
  mynet:
    driver: bridge
5. How to Run the Project
Run the following commands in your terminal:
# Step 1: Build and start containers
docker-compose up --build

# Step 2: Check running containers
docker ps

# Step 3: Access Nginx
# Open your browser and go to:
http://localhost:8080

# Step 4: View logs written by cron
docker logs <cron-logger-container-id>

# Step 5: Check Fluentd output
docker logs <fluentd-container-id>
6. Docker Networking

A custom bridge network mynet is created to allow containers to communicate using container names.
ping cron-logger
ping nginx

7. Data Persistence Test
8. Stop and remove containers:
9. docker-compose down
Restart:
docker-compose up

Check that previous logs are still available:
cat ./cron-logger/logs/cron.log

Resource Limits
Each container has CPU and memory restrictions defined in docker-compose.yml:
deploy:
  resources:
    limits:
      cpus: '0.5'
      memory: 256M
9. Cleanup

To remove all containers, volumes, and networks:
docker-compose down -v
10. Validation Checklist

‚úÖ Cron job logs written to /var/logs/cron.log
‚úÖ Logs persist after container restart
‚úÖ Fluentd prints log data to stdout
‚úÖ Nginx serves index.html on port 8080
‚úÖ All containers communicate via mynet
‚úÖ Resource limits applied correctly
